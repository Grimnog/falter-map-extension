## Sprint 4: Post-0.6.0 UX Improvements

**Completed:** 2026-01

### FALTMAP-21: Auto-Zoom After First 5 Geocoded Restaurants
- **Status:** Done ✅
- **Epic:** E04 (UI/UX Polish)
- **Priority:** High

**User Story:**
As a user, I want the map to automatically zoom to show my restaurants as soon as enough are loaded, so I don't have to manually adjust the view.

**Context:**
Users had to wait for all restaurants to be geocoded before seeing an appropriate map view. This created a poor initial experience, especially for large result sets.

**Solution:**
Implemented auto-zoom after the first 5 restaurants are successfully geocoded. This provides:
- Immediate visual feedback with a sensible map view
- Better perceived performance (map becomes useful quickly)
- Works for both small and large result sets

**Outcome:**
- Map automatically fits bounds after 5 restaurants
- Significantly improved initial user experience
- Users see a useful map view within 1-2 seconds of loading

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ Auto-zoom triggers after 5th successful geocode
- ✅ Map view includes all geocoded restaurants
- ✅ Works correctly for result sets < 5 and > 5 restaurants
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Manual testing confirmed improved UX

### FALTMAP-22: Modal Header Redesign with Falter Yellow Branding
- **Status:** Done ✅
- **Epic:** E04 (UI/UX Polish)
- **Priority:** High

**User Story:**
As a user, I want the extension to feel professional and visually connected to Falter's brand, so I trust it's a quality tool.

**Context:**
The modal header lacked clear branding and didn't align with Falter's visual identity. The design felt generic and didn't establish visual connection to Falter.

**Solution:**
Redesigned modal header with:
- Falter's signature yellow (#FFD700) as accent color
- Black text for optimal readability and contrast
- Clean, modern design that feels premium
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Outcome:**
- Professional, branded appearance
- Strong visual identity aligned with Falter
- Improved trust and perceived quality
- Better contrast and readability

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ Falter yellow (#FFD700) used in header
- ✅ Black text on yellow background (high contrast)
- ✅ Clean, modern design
- ✅ Manual testing confirmed improved aesthetics
- ✅ Consistent with Falter brand identity

### FALTMAP-23: German UI Text Throughout Modal
- **Status:** Done ✅
- **Epic:** E04 (UI/UX Polish)
- **Priority:** High

**User Story:**
As a German-speaking user on a German website (Falter.at), I want all UI text to be in German, so the experience feels native and professional.

**Context:**
The modal had mixed German and English text, creating an inconsistent and unprofessional user experience. Since Falter.at is a German-language publication, the extension should use German throughout.

**Solution:**
- Converted all UI text to German
- Cleaner header design (removed redundant text)
- Consistent language throughout the extension
- Professional, localized experience

**Changes:**
- "Show on Map" → "Auf Karte anzeigen"
- "Search running..." → "Suche läuft..."
- "Search completed" → "Suche abgeschlossen"
- All button labels, error messages, and status text converted to German

**Outcome:**
- Fully German UI, consistent with Falter.at
- Professional, native-feeling experience
- Cleaner, more refined design
- Better user trust and engagement

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ All modal text converted to German
- ✅ No English text remaining in UI
- ✅ Error messages in German
- ✅ Status messages in German
- ✅ Cleaner header design
- ✅ Manual testing confirmed language consistency
