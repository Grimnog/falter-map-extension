## 🚀 Current Sprint: UI/UX Polish

**Sprint Goal:** Polish the user interface and experience before expanding to Austria-wide support.

**Focus:** Epic E04 (UI/UX Polish) - Professional, consistent, delightful UX.

**Sprint Start:** 2026-01-30
**Target End:** TBD

**Rationale:**
After completing the "Reliable Foundation" sprint (E03), we now have ethical, reliable behavior. Before expanding scope with Austria-wide support (FALTMAP-26), we should polish what we have to ensure a high-quality user experience.

5. Make atomic commits following conventional commit format
6. Get User verification before marking as Done
7. Move completed tickets to `docs/CHANGELOG_TICKETS.md`
